In this project, I aim to extract historical stock price data from the internet, specifically focusing on the S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) using Python. The methodology employed for this task involves leveraging the yfinance library, a powerful tool for fetching financial data. The S&P 500, a renowned stock market index, serves as the primary source, monitoring and reflecting the performance of 500 major publicly traded companies in the United States. Recognized globally, it holds a prominent status as one of the most extensively observed and closely monitored equity indices. Due to its comprehensive representation of diverse sectors, the S&P 500 is considered a reliable gauge, offering insights into the overall health and dynamics of the American economy. Throughout this project, the objective is to effectively retrieve and analyze S&P historic stock price data, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of market trends and economic indicators.


The main objective of this project is to extract the Adjusted Closing price, denoted as "Adj Close," for all the companies listed here using with their respective ticker symbol and exporting the data in to  Csv file for further analysis.
